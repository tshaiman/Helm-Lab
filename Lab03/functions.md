## üéØ Objective
Get hands-on experience with Helm's Function capabilities.

estimated time: 10m

In this Tutorial we are going to have a basic look on how function works and what are the benefits of using them.

## üìö Instructions

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step1 : Inspect the existing Chart

1. Cd to Lab03 and open the existing "Video" chart with visual studio code.

2. We are going to change the file called _helpers.tpl which holds the function definitions.

3. By using your amazing Reverse Engineering skils , Google , Helm Docs and Co-Pilot , perform the following :

- on deployment.yaml line 31 add the container security context from the values file. 
- add a function called "video.image" that is concating the ACR name (Values.acr) the image name and the appVersion of the chart
e.g "vicorpacr.azurecr.io"/indexing-service:1.16.0"

**_NOTE:_** the places to change / add code are marked with +++ADD_CODE_HERE+++

4. Run the template in Lint Mode to ensure it is not missing values and/or has the right allignments.

```bash
helm lint video
```

   on the _helpers.tpl function add the following 

  ```yaml
    {{/*
    VI Image name
    */}}
    {{- define "Video.image" -}}
    {{- $separator := ":" -}}
    {{- $termination := 1.16 | toString -}}
    {{- if .Values.image.digest }}
        {{- $separator = "@" -}}
        {{- $termination = .Values.image.digest | toString -}}
    {{- end -}}
    {{- printf "%s/%s%s%s" .Values.image.acr .Values.image.repository $separator $termination }}
    {{- end }}

  ```
  Then , open deployment.yaml and change 
  ```yaml
    securityContext:
    +++ADD_CODE_HERE+++
    image: +++ADD_CODE_HERE+++
  ```
   to 
   
  ```yaml
    securityContext:
    {{- toYaml .Values.securityContext | nindent 10 }}
    image: {{ include "Video.image" . }}
  ```
